Thanks for installing the Cortex Self-Hosted helm chart!

Before you get started, make sure that you're able to generate browser-accessible DNS records for services in the cluster. Usually, this is handled by your Load Balancer of choice, which assigns hostnames to each service exposed by this helm chart.

If your load balancer enables TLS by default, make sure to update the "protocol" field in the helm chart.

This helm chart requires two hostnames: backend and frontend. We usually recommend api.*.com and app.*.com, respectively.

The following note is generated based on the configurations you've provided in the values.yaml file.

1. You can access the application at {{ template "appurl_unquoted" . }}.
2. An onboarding flow to set up services is accessible at {{ template "appurl_unquoted" . }}/admin/onboarding.
3. You'll automatically be logged in to workspace "{{ required "Change the workspace for your org" .Values.app.initialConfiguration.workspace }}".
4. Auth is disabled by default, however you can enable SSO at {{ template "appurl_unquoted" . }}/admin/settings/oidc.
